# Skeptic: I can either deny the lemma (P -> Q)->P or deny that the goal can be proved from it. In either case, I can either refute it myself or challenge you to prove it. In the first case, if I choose refutation, I have to prove (P -> Q) and refute P; in the second case if I choose refutation I have to refute (P->Q). if I instead challenge you, you either have to prove (P -> Q)->P or (P -> Q) depending on the branch I choose. I choose to challenge you to prove P->Q by offering you P and challenging you to prove Q

# Prover can refute (P -> Q)->P) or prove P or challenge Skeptic. Prover can choose to challenge skeptic to prove (P -> Q)->P) and refute P. Prover can offer P. If Prover chooses right, she is out of moves. If she chooses left, Prover offers P. Then the best skeptic can do is use a default to prove Q. But then Prover attacks on not(P) and skeptic is out of moves.

# Prover has a winning strategy: can always force Skeptic to lose. (Copy all alternatives from notes).

# Do the same for Dual Peirce's Law to show how Skeptic can enforce LNC.
